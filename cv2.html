<h3 align="center">Profile</h3>
<p align="center">Student at an International Cambridge School in Brussels, with a passion for
computers functionality,<br> computer gaming, Web Design and languages, I
would like to work in a dynamic and rewarding<br>environment where my
technical and personal skills could bring a positive input in the work<br>
environment and community.
I am extremely motivated, hard working and very open to start<br> a job in a
field such as restaurant catering, customer care or anything that will help
me to develop<br> my skills. I am a quick learner and an extremely positive
spirit that could adapt</p>

<h3 align="center">Experience</h3>
<h3 align="center">ACE OF BRUSSELS Cambridge International School, ACE WORKS
Program</h3>
<h4 align="center">Internship Student-Sep-2022-Present</h4>
<p>As a student at ACE OF BRUSSELS I am continuing my studies with ACE
following an A level Spanish and a Web Design course. As an intern, I am
helping out at ACE with creating digital marketing materials using Canva.
In addition, as part of internship at ACE, I have started to offer my help
as a Teaching Assistant to one of our primary classes in the Primary
School. I will be helping out 10 years old students with their work on
Maths and English during some of their school hours. This will help me
develop some skills on social interaction, organization and leadership. I
am also due to start an Internship on Web Design with my school in
January, as soon as I finish my first level on my Web Design course.</p>
